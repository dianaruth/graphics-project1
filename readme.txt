For the correct shading of a mesh, the custom shader needs the normal vector for each vertex. For the Phong-Illumination model,the color is approximated by the calculation of three components: a diffuse color, specular reflection, and an ambient component. These different surface properties are calculated using the equation used in Lab 5. Once the vertices and triangles were determined by the diamond-sqaure algorithm, the normals were recalculated using .RecalculateNormals() in order to store vertex normals of the mesh. The Phong Shader uses the normal vector of the surface, light vector(angle that it hits the surface), reflective vector(angle which light reflects off the surface), and viewer vector(angle of the perspective camera). The vertex is passed in with its world position, corresponding normal vector, and color, and then becomes transformed into a vertex with a vertex in relation to the camera, color, as well as a vertex and normal in world coordinates.
